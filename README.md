### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you dedicate the majority of your time and effort to something, it is amazing what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.

I'm a full-stack developer with a background in research-oriented psychology and a passion for creating engaging, well-crafted, and interactive pages/applications. Known as a critical thinker, insightful contributor, and one who works well with and motivates members of project teams. I am well versed in using a variety of technologies to efficiently solve problems and enhance user experiences through refined functionality and detail-oriented design. Able to rapidly learn and implement new technologies and adapt to the demands of any project. 

Ready to apply skills as part of a quality-driven team to craft products which people are delighted to use and leave them with an indelible positive impression of the organization those products represent.
